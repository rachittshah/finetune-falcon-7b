## Setup

To run this code, several libraries need to be installed including:

- `trl` (for SFTTrainer)
- `transformers` (for models and tokenizers)
- `accelerate` (for training acceleration)
- `peft` (for efficient fine-tuning)
- `datasets` (for loading datasets)
- `bitsandbytes` (for model quantization)
- `einops` (required for loading Falcon models)
- `wandb` (for experiment tracking)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install trl transformers accelerate datasets bitsandbytes einops wandb
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft.git
```

## Dataset

The code uses the Guanaco dataset, a clean subset of the OpenAssistant dataset adapted to train general purpose chatbots. The dataset can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco).

## Model

The model being fine-tuned is the [Falcon 7B model](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b). This model is quantized to 4 bits to save memory and then attached to LoRA adapters.

## Training

The code uses `SFTTrainer` from the TRL library, which provides a wrapper around the transformers `Trainer` to easily fine-tune models on instruction based datasets using PEFT adapters.

The model is trained with the following parameters:

- Output directory: `./results`
- Per device training batch size: 4
- Gradient accumulation steps: 4
- Optimizer: `paged_adamw_32bit`
- Save steps: 10
- Logging steps: 10
- Learning rate: 2e-4
- Max grad norm: 0.3
- Max steps: 500
- Warmup ratio: 0.03
- LR scheduler type: `constant`

## Post-Training

After training, the model should converge nicely. The `SFTTrainer` also takes care of properly saving only the adapters during training instead of saving the entire model.

## Usage

To use the code, simply run it in a Google Colab environment after installing the required libraries and importing the Guanaco dataset. The code will handle the rest, from loading the model and fine-tuning it to saving the results. 

## Note

The code uses Google Colab for the fine-tuning process. It may not work as expected if run in a different environment. 

Also, remember that fine-tuning large models like Falcon 7B requires significant computational resources. Please ensure your environment has sufficient resources to avoid any issues during the fine-tuning process.
